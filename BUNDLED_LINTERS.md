The following code is instantly recognizable as wrong `$x?->someMethodAsync()`, but the typechecker will not emit an error for it. _A `?Awaitable<_>` doesn't trigger the "you must await this check".\_                                         |

The easiest way to prevent this bug is to disallow ignored `new` expressions. This proved to be a useful rule, regardless of the type of the expression, so the behavior applies to any `new` expression.                     |

This is terrible for performance, since no other `Awaitables` (except for those blocking the current one) are allowed to run. Just use `await`. If you are in a not in an async context, make it async. If you end up in a `__construct()` method, you must create an async factory method and hand the `T` to the constructor, instead of doing async work in the constructor.    |

In these cases, you may prefer to use an `if (...)` statement or to assign the resulting value to `$_` to signal this unidiomatic use of `&&`.                   |

Not using the `$$` on the RHS of a `\|>` expression is almost always a bug. This error often takes the following form `Vec\filter($things, lambda) \|> Vec\map($things, lambda);` The `$things` variable has the same type as `$$`, so the typechecker does not flag this as an error and the filtered result is not used.                                 |

This linter also fires for unused parameters, which hurt maintainability. Naming unused parameters `$_` which are forced by the Liskov Substitution Principle ensures callers you won't use it. They may pass any type correct value. In other cases, the local variable is merely redundant. |
